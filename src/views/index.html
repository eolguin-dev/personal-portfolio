                    Hello! My name is Eduardo, and I am an industrial engineer with 
                    two years of experience in the field. I specialize in process 
                    improvement, project management, and data analysis. <br>
                    <br>
                    One of my strengths is my ability to analyze complex data sets and 
                    identify areas for improvement. I am skilled in using statistical 
                    tools such as Six Sigma and Lean methodology to streamline processes 
                    and reduce waste. <br>
                    <br>
                    When I'm not working, I enjoy coding & learning new languages. I am also 
                    committed to help kids in my community to learn matemathics. <br>
                    <br>
                    Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit more about me. I look 
                    forward to connecting with you and exploring opportunities to work 
                    together.

                <h2>Project 1: Reducing Manufacturing Cycle Time</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                Problem: The manufacturing process at a large electronics company was 
                taking too long, resulting in missed delivery deadlines and decreased 
                customer satisfaction.
                Solution: Using Six Sigma methodology, a team led by myself analyzed the 
                manufacturing process and identified bottlenecks and inefficiencies. 
                We implemented a new scheduling system, redesigned the production line 
                layout, and trained employees on new processes and procedures.
                Results: The manufacturing cycle time was reduced by 30%, resulting in a 
                significant improvement in delivery performance and an increase in 
                customer satisfaction.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Project 2: Supply Chain Optimization</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                Problem: A retail company was experiencing high inventory carrying costs 
                due to inefficiencies in their supply chain. 
                Solution: As the project manager, I led a team that analyzed the entire 
                supply chain, from sourcing to distribution, and identified areas for 
                improvement. We implemented a new inventory management system, optimized 
                shipping routes, and renegotiated supplier contracts.
                Results: The company was able to reduce their inventory carrying costs by 20% and 
                improve their on-time delivery performance by 15%.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>Project 3: Lean Manufacturing Implementation</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                Problem: A manufacturing company was experiencing high levels of waste and 
                low productivity due to inefficient processes.
                Solution: Using Lean methodology, I led a team that identified and 
                eliminated waste in the production process, streamlined workflows, and 
                implemented visual management systems to improve communication and 
                transparency.
                Results: The company was able to reduce their production costs by 25%, 
                increase productivity by 30%, and improve their product quality by 15%.
                In each project, I played a key role in leading and implementing process 
                improvement initiatives, utilizing my skills in project management, data 
                analysis, and lean methodology. Through these projects, I have demonstrated my ability to identify and 
                solve complex problems and achieve measurable results.
